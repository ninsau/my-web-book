## What Will You Learn?

### HTML: The Building Blocks

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundational stone of web development. It's the standard markup language used to create web pages. You'll learn about elements, attributes, and how to structure your web content effectively. Think of HTML as the skeleton of a web page; it provides the essential structure and meaning.

### CSS: Styling Your Web

Once you've got the HTML structure down, the next step is to make it visually appealing. That's where CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) comes in. You'll learn how to style your web pages, from basic color changes to intricate layout designs. CSS is like the skin and clothing that make the HTML skeleton look good.

### Bootstrap: Speed Up Development

After mastering HTML and CSS, you'll be introduced to Bootstrapâ€”a powerful framework that simplifies web development. With Bootstrap, you can create beautiful, responsive designs with minimal effort. Think of it as a toolkit full of pre-designed components that save you time and effort.

### JavaScript: Adding Interactivity

Last but not least, you'll dive into JavaScriptâ€”the programming language that adds interactivity to your web pages. You'll learn how to manipulate the DOM, handle events, and create dynamic content. JavaScript is like the muscles that allow the HTML skeleton to move and interact.
