## HTML Basics

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It structures your web content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose or wrap different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way.

### Key Points

- **Elements**: HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
- **Attributes**: Elements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element.
- **Tags**: Elements are represented by tags.

#### Example

```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<a href="#">This is a link</a>
```

## CSS Basics

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling HTML elements. It describes how HTML elements should be displayed on screen.

### Key Points

- **Selectors**: Used to select the HTML element you want to style.
- **Properties**: The CSS properties like `font-size`, `color`, `margin`, etc., you want to apply.
- **Values**: Each property is given a value to style the HTML element.

#### Example

```css
/* This is a comment */
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
h1 {
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}
```

## Bootstrap Basics

Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based design templates.

### Key Points

- **Responsive**: Makes it easy to create responsive designs.
- **Components**: Comes with a lot of pre-designed components like buttons, navbars, etc.
- **Utilities**: Provides utility classes for faster development.

#### Example

```html
<!-- Bootstrap Button -->
<button class="btn btn-primary">Click Me</button>

<!-- Bootstrap Card -->
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">This is a card.</div>
</div>
```

## Additional Tips

### Replacing Image Links

In the examples, you'll often see placeholder image links like `image1.jpg`. You should replace these with the actual paths to the images you want to use.

### Comments

Comments are not displayed in the browser but can be useful for leaving notes in your code. In HTML, comments are wrapped in `<!-- -->` and in CSS, they are wrapped in `/* */`.
